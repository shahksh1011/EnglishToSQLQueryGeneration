# EnglishToSQLQueryGeneration
In this robotic age, all the companies store their data in datasets and recover from them. It is a long haul want of computer users to limit the correspondence hole between the PC and a human. Recovering data from the database requires information of specialized dialects, for example, Structured Query Language. A handful of computer users have technical background and are intimidated by the idea of using languages such as SQL. Our project is a machine translation project which will enable user to query the database in a language more like English and convert it into an SQL query to fetch data.
